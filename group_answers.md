You're going to learn a new programming language today. Don't worry, we'll still go back to JavaScript.

Today we'll learn Markdown. Here are two resources:
* [Markdown la gi](https://www.codehub.vn/Markdown-La-Gi)
* [The ultimate guide to Markdown](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)

Your **mission** is to _write a recap_, in Markdown, of the topics we covered on Monday. We'll divide into three groups, each of which will cover one topic. 


Each group has a prompt. Answer _at least_ these questions, and offer examples of each. This should be done in the markdown language. 

* **Group 1**: Variables
  * What are the different variable types?
  * How do we declare variables?
  * What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
  * How should we name variables? 
  * **BONUS**: What does "scope" mean, when it applies to variables? 
  * **DOUBLE BONUS**: Google for "passing variables by value or reference" in JavaScript. Explain what this is about. 

* **Group 2**: Functions 
  * How do we declare a function?
  * What is the difference between functions and methods?
  * How do we declare arguments to a function?
  * How do we return a value from a function?
  * **BONUS**: How do we return multiple values from a function?
  * **DOUBLE BONUS**: How do I pass an unlimited number of arguments to a function?


* **Group 3**: If Statements and control flow
  * How do we declare an if/else statement?
  * How do we make an if statement that checks two conditions? For example: check if a number less than 100 and even. 
  * Spoiler alert: in the previous question we used `&&`. What are the other "logical" operators?
  * If we have many if statements, we can use something called a switch statement. Give an example of a switch statement.
  * **BONUS**: What is the difference between `==` and `===`? 
  * **DOUBLE BONUS**: What is a ternary operator? Give examples and why you would use it.
  

Here's an example of what each group should produce:

# Group X: Explaining Topic
Hello, we are 
* Ta
* Teammate 2
* Teammate 3

We are going to explain `If Statements and control flow`. Please enjoy the following explanation. But first, include a picture.
